# Openhouse Test

If I had more time:
- Implement unit testing in Jest
- More rules around image url so that the app doesn't deliberately load large images in places when it doesn't need to
- More separation of logic from UI components


### Misc
Mountview - Winston Heights in North East Calgary has an unusually long name and looks inconsistent to other community names, so it could've potentially been reduced to Mountview - Winston Heights. However such a decision requires involving stakeholders as it's entirely possible there's a valid reason why it the original data source kept that label. Thus, I made the decision to design around having community names.
